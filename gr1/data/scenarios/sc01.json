  "title": "Employer introduces GLA & PHI for higher earners",
  "vignette": "Acme Ltd (UK) is introducing a Group Life Assurance (GLA) of 4x salary and a PHI scheme covering 60% of salary after 26 weeks' deferred period. Eligibility is offered to employees earning above £60,000 with 2+ years' service. The broker has proposed a Registered GLA with a master trust and a unit-rated PHI policy. HR is concerned about tax, underwriting, and communications.",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "sc01q1",
      "stem": "For the Registered GLA arrangement, which of the following is typically TRUE with respect to tax?",
      "options": [
        "Employer premiums are a taxable benefit in kind for employees",
        "GLA benefits are paid free of income tax when within the Lifetime Allowance",
        "Death benefits are usually written in trust, keeping them outside the estate",
        "Employee contributions are required for Registered GLA to be valid"
      ],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Registered GLA is typically written in trust so benefits are usually outside the estate (IHT efficient). Employer premiums are generally not a BiK; Lifetime Allowance limits were historically relevant—but current UK LTA rules have changed. Focus on the trust aspect and current exam wording."
