      "stem": "A GLA scheme pays 3× pensionable salary on death in service. Pensionable salary is 90% of basic salary. If basic salary is £60,000, what is the lump-sum benefit?",
      "options": ["£162,000", "£180,000", "£200,000", "£216,000"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Pensionable salary = 0.9 × £60,000 = £54,000. Benefit = 3 × £54,000 = £162,000."

      "stem": "Which statement about discretionary trusts in GLA is MOST accurate?",
      "options": [
        "They make the employee’s nomination legally binding.",
        "They typically allow faster payment and potential inheritance‑tax advantages.",
        "They remove the need for any claims assessment.",
        "They require all beneficiaries to be named in the policy schedule."
      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Discretionary trusts allow trustees to decide recipients, often speeding payment and improving tax efficiency. Nominations are guidance, not binding."

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Pricing depends on risk factors (age, occupation) and experience. SLA wording on claims service has minimal direct impact on pure risk cost."

      ],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "FCL simplifies onboarding by allowing cover up to a limit without individual underwriting; above it, evidence may be required."
