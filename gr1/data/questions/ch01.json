      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Insurance pools catastrophic risk and smooths costs; admin responsibilities may remain and medical evidence can still be required above thresholds."
    },

      "id": 102,
      "stem": "Which participant typically designs scheme benefits, tenders to insurers, and manages ongoing governance on behalf of the employer?",

      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Multinational pooling aggregates results across countries and may return a dividend if experience is good."
